# Cypress Testing Demo

This is a demonstration of features and capabilities of Cypress for testing web applications. I have put this together in order to demonstrate the skills I can bring to an organization.

You can find the tests in the cypress > e2e folder.

These tests validate the functionality and the corresponding projects. As a bonus, I set up a web runner via SauceLabs for easy record keeping of results. These results can be found [here for Expanding Cards](https://app.saucelabs.com/tests/523ac8a2e3da4fd3b76d8da36eacc3b5) and [here for Form Wave](https://app.saucelabs.com/tests/fc13c51d37e647c6907821ee872fd3e6).

Expanding Cards is fairly common feature on many websites. As you can see, all of the tests pass successfully. On the next test, we have a form without validation implemented. As a result, we can write a test that will allow our developers to verify the form validation is working successfully when they write the code that outputs the page.
