# Cypress Testing Demo

This is a demonstration of features and capabilities of Cypress for testing web applications. I have put this together in order to demonstrate the skills I can bring to an organization.

You can find the tests in the cypress > e2e folder.

These tests validate the functionality and the corresponding projects. As a bonus, I set up a web runner via SauceLabs for easy record keeping of results.

- Expanding-Cards is fairly common feature on many websites. As you can see, all of the tests pass successfully. View the [results here](https://app.saucelabs.com/tests/523ac8a2e3da4fd3b76d8da36eacc3b5).

- On the next test, we have a form without validation implemented. As a result, we can write a test that will allow our developers to verify the form validation is working successfully when they write the code that outputs the page. This shows how we can catch errors before they go live. View the [results here](https://app.saucelabs.com/tests/fc13c51d37e647c6907821ee872fd3e6).

- Here we have a static web page todo-list application. We are able to verify setup and functionality separately. You can view the [results here](https://app.saucelabs.com/tests/45b2de6eef334a35b44ba19b8e2abc79).
